Hi, I'm Johan from Cusco, Peru. As a young computer graduate passionate about technology and nature, I've gained expertise in machine learning and software development since I started my career in 2018. 

Programming contests are one of my hobbies, and I have participated in events like *[RPC](https://redprogramacioncompetitiva.com/)*, ICPC Regionals, and Codeforces.

During my studies, I worked on projects using techs like React, C#, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and MS SQL server. I also have experience building and training machine learning neural network models.
