I'm from the National University San Antonio Abad del Cusco. I specialize in **software development** and **machine learning** and have gained valuable experience through participating in coding competitions.

As a recent graduate, I am eager to start my professional career and utilize the skills and knowledge I have acquired during my studies. I am open to remote or on-site opportunities and am willing to work from anywhere.
